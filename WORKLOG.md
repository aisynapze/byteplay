# BytePlay worklog

## 2026-10-29

- Verified main HEAD `bb366d5102085477b7270d7982e60712cc23fb41` exactly matches audited baseline; no drift.
- Created implementation branch. Inspected existing Go server, anacrolix/torrent, FFprobe/remux, vanilla JS, Docker and npm lockfile.
- Added first Phase 0 security changes and regression tests; these are not fully validated.
- Added self-hosted Linux/x64 CI workflow. GitHub Actions query currently shows zero runs; runner labels/capabilities cannot be verified with available permissions.
- Runtime Go 1.26.6, seeded torrent, FFmpeg integration and browser checks have NOT been executed.
- M1 remains incomplete; P0 proxy peer/tracker egress and complete security/error tests are outstanding.
- Next action: run CI on the branch, fix observed build/test regressions, complete M1, then M2–M8.

- Latest observed CI run: https://github.com/aisynapze/byteplay/actions/runs/40951000330 — QUEUED, not passed. No runner binding verified. Tests and formatting still require execution.

- Owner-approved temporary CI policy update: use GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` for BytePlay quality jobs; retain self-hosted runners as a later option. Commit `76c5da86c12f1bff112bae0cfbe6b953018c2151`. Run #40951738080 started on GitHub-hosted infrastructure; full result not yet verified.

## 2026-10-29 — dependency download audit

- CI run #40951738080 failed in explicit `go mod download` after ~195 seconds with HTTP/2 proxy errors for Pion datachannel/DTLS and zombiezen sqlite.
- Removed eager `go mod download` from .github/workflows/ci.yml, using `go build ./...` to fetch only imported build dependencies under `GOFLAGS=-mod=readonly` and preserving setup-go caching.
- CI run #40953063735: gofmt, go build, go mod verify and go vet PASS on a cold GitHub-hosted runner; build fetched 73 modules. Pion datachannel and DTLS were fetched by build; zombiezen.com/go/sqlite was not.
- Dockerfile also had eager download; replaced it with BuildKit Go module/build cache mounts and lazy build with readonly module manifest.
- Unit test T-003 failed because oversized request content length was not checked before invalid multipart parsing; added early 413 ContentLength check while retaining MaxBytesReader for streaming/unknown-length bodies.
- No dependency versions changed; no `go mod tidy` or removal of transitive dependencies without import graph evidence.
- New CI run for latest branch must still complete before full gate status can be recorded.
